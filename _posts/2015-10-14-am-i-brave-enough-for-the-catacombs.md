Ever since becoming a zombie some time in the nineties I've never felt fully at home among all these warm bodies. I'm not sure if my boss has noticed my trailing limbs but I suspect she thinks something is up! I think that it's important to get back to basics sometimes, and what is more basic for a fun loving undead than the actual dead?! For me it's not bravery, just a desire to relax somewhere really peaceful ;)
